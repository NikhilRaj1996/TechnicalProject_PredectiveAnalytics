for this code, the global power plant dataset is given.
this code is written for modeling and visualization using python.

so first the necessary libraries are imported the data cleaning is done using python.

then the random forest classification and decision tree classification is applied to the data set for calculating the accuracy score and then create the confusion matrix.

then the z-hypothesis test is applied for calculating the z-score and p-value.

at last, the plots are created using matplotlib for visualizing the data.
